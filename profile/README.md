## PROBLEM:  Reinsurance premium processing is extraordinarily inefficient – settling in T+180 days.
* Premiums must be received, custodied, and remitted at each step in the risk-transfer chain between cedents, brokers, and reinsurers.
* Each party maintains a separate ledger that must be manually updated and reconciled with counterparties at each step in the chain.
* Reinsurance contracts are complex, with many participants entitled to a portion of the premiums.  Each broker or intermediary is likewise entitled to a commission or fee.  Accounting for, and allocating, these payments at each step in the risk-transfer chain increases delay and often introduces errors and uncertainty.
* Coordinating these payments between participants via email is cumbersome and costly, sometimes leading to conflicts.
* International transfers require correspondent banking relationships, which introduce further friction and delay.
* Cultural, language, location, interpretation differences take a toll on what should be a smooth process of letting risk premiums flow through liable intermediaries.

## COSTS TO THE INDUSTRY:  £ Billions in Processing Costs and Trapped Value.
* 68% of Lloyd's net written premiums were outstanding at year-end 2022 – a shortfall of £23.58B (including write-offs).
* Lloyd’s could realize £150M in risk-free profit by receiving premiums 30-days sooner (T+150).
* Lloyd’s spent £996M in processing costs in 2022.
* Delays in settlement introduce credit risk and require premium financing, letters of credit.
* Delays in receipt reduces funds available for claims reserves, decreasing ability to cover additional risk.
* Severe, constant contractual uncertainty for re/insurers as they take more than 50% of the on risk period in order to collect. (leading to large possibility of losses before settlement)

## RESOLVR’S SOLUTION:  The Reinsurance Premium Manager (RPM) platform – real-time, automated insurance premium processing and settlement.
* RPM consolidates the many separate spreadsheets in the risk-transfer chain into a single platform for coordinating and automating premium allocation, accounting, invoicing, and payment.  RPM tracks payments over the life of the policy, using the contract as the single source of truth.
* Parties import contract terms and generate a single invoice per payment that covers all parties’ amounts due along the chain.  RPM coordinates approvals from the parties to ensure accuracy.
* Once cedent pays the invoice, RPM automatically splits the premium and pays all parties simultaneously (fees, commissions, and percentages of premiums due).  Payment execution is instant.
* Multi-currency transactions allow parties to receive funds in their individually preferred currency. Resolvr and its payments partners handle remittance and conversion - at a fraction of the cost of conventional banking solutions.

## RESOLVR'S ADVANTAGE: The Bitcoin and Lightning Networks – Resolvr provides all the benefits of the Bitcoin network, without the volatility or tax burden of the Bitcoin asset.
* Bitcoin enables same-day cross-border transaction settlements.  The Bitcoin Lightning Network (a protocol for accelerating native bitcoin payments) enables instant cross-border settlement.
* Bitcoin is programmable money, enabling single payments to be split and shared with unlimited numbers of recipients, automatically and simultaneously.
* Bitcoin is the most secure, reliable payments network and money in existence (100% uptime last 10 years, 99.98% uptime over its lifespan, immutable and finite supply/issuance schedule).
* Bitcoin dominates the digital asset ecosystem:  (largest market cap - $1.16T, deepest liquidity, comprising >55% of entire asset class). (Read more: https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/research-and-insights/bitcoin-first-revisited)
